Subsequently, another gentleman approaches, extends both hands, and firmly clasps the man’s right hand. Both men stand, and one person extends his left hand, making a thumbs-down gesture toward the other person, who then extends his right hand and strikes him. They continue to stand facing each other until the first person takes a step forward, reaching out with both hands to grab the second person's left upper arm and leading him or her forward a few steps. One person holds the other person’s hand with his or her right hand while walking on his or her shoulder, as the other person jumps forward, holding the first person’s hand. Then, one person crouches down and carries him or her. The two people stand facing each other, with their right hands flat in front, their left hands gently beating their right hands, as they perform rock-paper-scissors three times. The first person raises his or her right hand, while the second person raises both hands. They clasp the right hand of the first person and shake it up and down in a handshake.</b>

      <b>The two people almost bump into each other, and one person raises his hands to his chest and walks aside. One person covers the other person's right ear with both hands and whispers, while the other person covers his or her mouth with both hands.
